# Week 3: React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS – Mastering Front-End Development

## 🚀 Objective
Build a responsive React application using JSX and Tailwind CSS that demonstrates component architecture, state management, hooks usage, and API integration.

---
## ⚙️ Task 1: Project Setup (React + Tailwind)
- Created a new React project using **Vite**
- Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS**
- Verified that Tailwind styles load correctly in the app

## 🧠 Task 3: State Management and Hooks

- Implemented a `Counter` component that uses:
  - **useState** for managing state (count value)
  - **useEffect** for handling side effects (saving to localStorage)
  - **Custom Hook (`useLocalStorage`)** for persistent data
- The counter allows users to:
  - Increment, Decrement, and Reset values
  - Retain the count even after refreshing the page
- Styled the component using Tailwind CSS

## 🌐 Task 4: API Integration
- Fetched data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
- Displayed data in grid view with loading and error states
- Added search and pagination
